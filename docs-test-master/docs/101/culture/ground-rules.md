### Great Delivery
- Always analyze the task to define DoD before coding.
- Take time to test carefully before passing to QA (using DoD checklist or smock test from QA)
- Always try your best to deliver before the deadline (if possible)
- Before releasing something to production, think about:
  - domain whitelist as we may use some domain for static resources but not in the whitelist yet
  - any security risks
  - how many domains will be supported once we release to production (binance.com, binancezh.io)
  - google form (as it seems not available in Chinese)
  - i18n make sure it works as well
...

### Great Collaboration
- Always try to understand clearly about your products: 5W + 1H (What, Why, Who, Where, When + How)
- Be pro-active to contribute ideas/suggestions to improve products/coding quality/...
- Don't just stop at the requirements, always ask your self: Is there anything we can do it better?
- Willing to support others if possible
- Have no issues in expressing your ideas to others
- Have daily / weekly summary on projects that you're working on to keep everyone on the same page (for your project, not for Kael or Roger)
- Documentation Driven
    面对面交谈、电话语音、微信、Slack虽然是比较实时的反馈工具，但是只有文档是可以把重要信息给结构化的，而且写文档其实是比起前面的方式来说是更为深度的思考，因为会让你自己审视自己的想法。所以，对于一些重要 “功能”、“流程”、“业务逻辑” 、“设计”、“问题”，以及“想法”，最好都以文档化的方式进行。请使用Github的 wiki、project、issue这些工具或是使用Google Doc.
...
### Smart Risk Taking
- Take lesson learned from the past incidents (from everyone in the team) to prevent it in the future.
- When you have a task, please check if you can meet the deadline or not.
- For a rush project, please think about the priority and discuss with PMs to findout what can be done in that time.
