In probability theory, a logit-normal distribution is a probability distribution of a random variable whose logit has a normal distribution and it is bounded by zero and one, and where values of zero and one never occur.

we use the logit-normal distribution to define our logitnormal function. To decide the final logitnormal for one metric score, P10 and Median value is required, the developers can use this tools [Lighthouse Scoring Calculator](www.desmos.com/calculator/o98tbeyt1t?lang=zh-CN) to decide the correct P10 and Median value.

P10 value means when the performance metrics is this value, the metric score is 90. Median means the score is 50.s
