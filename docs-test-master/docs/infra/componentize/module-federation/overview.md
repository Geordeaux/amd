## Module federation

Module federation is a technique that allow remote bundle to be served and consumed by any application. It allow shared bundled to be used on runtime instead of build phase. This allows the modification of the bundle to be seamlessly imported and used.

## Limitations/Caveats
Module federation is relatively a new technology, and most of the cases is considered for the browser. The nodejs side have much holes to filled to be able to used it practically.

## Use case
We plan to use module federation for our main-user-center-ui. More details [here](/docs/infra/module-federation/mainuc-use-case).
