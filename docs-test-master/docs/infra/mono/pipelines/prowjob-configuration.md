title: Publish Prowjob Configuration
---


This article will describe in detail the meaning and usage scenarios of prowjob.

You can find prowjob configuration source here `infra/prow/jobs/prowjobs-pr-publish-mono.yaml`.

A simple example:

![snapshot](https://static.devfdg.net/static/mono-static/docs-ui/img/prowjob-example.png)

You can follow the steps below:
1. Change value `help-center-ui` to your app name, change field `github_users` to the owner. 
2. Focus on the `publish-mono` in the `command` field, look down for detailed introduction.

> The `--${key} ${value}` in the code is the parameter of prowjob. Also some parameters are like switch, you only need to declare to turn it on or off, just like the `--enable_pr_injection` above

> [CICD Management](https://cicd-manage-fe.toolsfdg.net) will help you do this more easily.
