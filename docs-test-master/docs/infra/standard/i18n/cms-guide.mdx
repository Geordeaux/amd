> Please avoid gray header `k8scluster: ture` while using the CMS.

## Overview

I18n CMS manages front-end UI strings, serves product teams, developer teams, and the Localization team.
Provide three basic functions to manage the English strings (source strings) of internationalization(I18n)[^1],
connects to Smartling[^2] to sync translations, and publish string online.

## Source String Format & Rules

The basic principle of source format is to ensure translatability.
It must meet the following rules:

1. It must be a complete sentence, clauses and missing content are not allowed.
2. Placeholders should use double curly braces, e.g. {{user}}.
3. Placeholders should have straight-forward meaning to read and maintain.
4. Please avoid using rich text HTML syntax, avoid having attr in it, such as link styles, etc.
5. Fill in the instruction to let the translator understand the context to ensure the quality of the translation.
6. Fill in max length when necessary to prevent translation from breaking the UI.

For legacy non-standard string, they should be gradually replaced in the future.

### Examples

#### Basic string

```json
{"example-basic":"Hello World!"}
```

#### String with placeholder

```json
{"example-placeholder": "Hello {{userName}}!"}
```

#### Plurals

Source

```json
{
  "example-count": "{{count}} item",
  "example-count_plural": "{{count}} items"
}
```

Usage

```javascript
i18next.t('example-count', {count: 0}); // -> "0 items"
i18next.t('example-count', {count: 1}); // -> "1 item"
i18next.t('example-count', {count: 5}); // -> "5 items"
i18next.t('example-count', {count: 100}); // -> "100 items"
```

#### String with React Component

Source

```json
{"example-component": "Please read and agree to <t>Terms of Use</t> and <p>Privacy Policy</p>"}
```

Note: Do not use number tag such as `<0>test<0/>`, Smartling dose not support this. You will get `&lt;0&gt;test&lt;0/&gt;`.

Usage [[1]](https://react.i18next.com/latest/trans-component#alternative-usage-v-11-6-0)

```jsx
<Trans
  i18nKey="example-component"
  components={{ t: <Link href="https://link1" />, p: <Link href="https://link2" /> }}
/>
```

## I18n CMS

### Register & Login

If you are new, contact Archer(lee.l@binance.com) to create an account.


### File Page

After login with Okta, you can access the file page,
You can click the file name to the file detail page,
and you can add a new file in this page.

### File Detail Page

You can see "Add strings" in the top, click to the "Add strings" page,and  two tabs "String" and "Job".

#### Add Strings

In this page, you can add a bunch of strings and submit it to a Job, you should hold the job name you created.
after submit new content should available in DEV environment, you should punlish to PROD before your new version go released.

#### Strings management

The only the max length and instruction is editable a string has created, You can click "Update" to change it.
The Environment shows which environment the string in, can be DEV(development) and PROD(production).


#### Jobs Page

You can see the Job list with job name, author and create time. click punlish strings to publish string from DEV to PROD.

### Translation sync

All the string in this system will push to Smartling for translation,
and each language of the translation of the string will sync automatically.
The changed data will effect the web page after all layer of caches[^3] has expired.


### API

GET {path}/{locale}/{namespace}

E.g. https://static.devfdg.net/api/i18n/-/web/cms/en/accounts-ui

### PARAMETERS

  **locale - string**

  **namespace - string**

  * equal to the file name of CMS, e.g. accounts-ui

  **path - string**

  * `{path}` path is available in common-ui of ConfigMap named `I18N_BASE_PUBLIC`/`I18N_BASE_PRIVATE`.
  * `STATIC_HOST_PUBLIC` is the public service address for client side or local service.
  * `STATIC_HOST_PRIVATE` is the private service address for SSR(server side render)

  For Example

```js
import { queryI18nResourceV2 } from '@binance/api'

// if your nodejs(SSR) service can accesss `I18N_BASE_PRIVATE`
const basePath = typeof window !== 'undefined' || __DEV__ ? I18N_BASE_PUBLIC : I18N_BASE_PRIVATE

// if your nodejs(SSR) service can't accesss `I18N_BASE_PRIVATE`
const basePath = I18N_BASE_PUBLIC
const i18n = await queryI18nResourceV2({
    basePath,
    locale,
    namespace,
  })

```

### Release Guide

Before the new version got released, the new key should available in PROD Environment.

Check List:

1. All string in the job got published, you can filter Environment by PROD and search key to check it.
2. According the CDN cache expiration setting, you should also check if the key is present in the path, e.g. https://bin.bnbstatic.com/api/i18n/-/web/cms/zh-CN/Navigation

### Migration

Before the Migration you should get access of the CMS first.

1. Notify all the teams which using the File you want to migrate, and stop update it in mono.
2. Create all File your project using，name must be equal to the json file without `.json`, e.g. `accounts-ui.json` becomes `accounts-ui` as file name.
3. Using "Upload JSON" in the add strings page.
4. Click "Create Job" to create a Job, hold the job name.
5. Find the job by the job name, Click publish select all to submit。
6. If you have any PR in progress, you should also create a job with the PR changes, but you don't need to submit translation requirements again.
7. Change the codebase and do the release process as usual, ref:[launchpad-ui migration PR](https://git.toolsfdg.net/mono/mono/pull/32301)
