[中文版](language-region-code-zh-cn)

* For languages used in only one region or for global users, we only use the ISO 639-1 language code: `{language}`

  E.g.

  ```
  https://www.binance.com/en
  https://www.binance.com/ja
  https://www.binance.com/ko
  ```

* For multiple regions using the same language, we add the additional ISO 3166-1 region code: `{language}-{region}`

  E.g.

  ```
  https://www.binance.com/en-AU
  https://www.binance.com/en-IN
  https://www.binance.com/en-NG
  ```

Publishing a new language requires communication with the localization team whether the language needs to be translated by the localization team.

If the localization team needs to maintain it, then add the corresponding language-region code in Smartling.
If only existing languages are used, I18n system configuration language mapping is required

There is one exception in our code: Filipino is not in ISO 639-1 and we use `ph`.

You can find the full supported language list in [Language Menu API](https://www.binance.com/gateway-api/v1/public/common/config/getLanguageMapByKey).
