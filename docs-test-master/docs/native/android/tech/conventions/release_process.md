### Release process

The regression package is packaged with the developer branch

When the Code Freeze period is reached, the code of the developer branch needs to be merged into the pre-release. Provide the official version of qa for testing.

Code merging process
The developer's code is merged into the prerelase branch, and the jenkins script under jenkins will be found from this branch.

During Code Freeze to gray release, if new code is submitted, you need to go through the PR application process and merge the code into the hotfix branch. The hotfix pr is provided to pre-release and dev, and packaged on pre-release.

If the version is released urgently (a minor version), at this time dev already has the next version of the code, first merge to the hotfix branch, and then merge to the pre-release branch after the test is passed, and pr is provided to pre-release and dev respectively. Then package from pre-release.

The pre-release after the release is merged with the master, and then tagged.
