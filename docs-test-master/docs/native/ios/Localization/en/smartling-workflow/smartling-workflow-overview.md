## Overview

In order to meet the management requirements of the Localization team, we now need to migrate the Crowdin system to a professional TMS (Translation Management System) Smartling.

Smartling is a professional translation management system, but it does not provide source files management, so currently we have decided to manage source files and source strings based on git (we may make our own CMS system in the future).
