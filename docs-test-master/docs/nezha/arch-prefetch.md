> Timingï¼šBinance App Cold Start

Binance App cold started, requests the prefetch api. The MP resource that is needed would be downloaded concurrently (reuse the code of [Dynamic update strategy](https://docs.fe.devfdg.net/docs/nezha/arch-download)) if the response is not empty. If a user opens a MP that is prefetching, the loading page shows, and then starts the MP when prefetch finishes.
